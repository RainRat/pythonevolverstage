# Benchmarks Directory

This folder stores assembled benchmark warriors organised by arena (for example, `arena0/`, `arena1/`, etc.).

It is intentionally empty in the repository so contributors can populate it with their own benchmark sets.  
The automated test suite and default configuration only require that the directory exists.
