# EVOLUTION PHASES (ERAS)

# The tool progresses through three phases: 1. Exploration, 2. Breeding, 3. Optimization.
# Settings below use three values corresponding to these three phases.

# Mutation Strategies:
# Think of these as a bag of "marbles" of seven different colors.
# When a new warrior is created, a "marble" is picked to decide how to change an instruction.
# Higher numbers make that mutation type more likely.

# NOTHING: No change is made to the instruction.

# RANDOM: Replaces the instruction with a completely random one.

# NAB: Borrows an instruction from a warrior in a different arena.

# MINI_MUT: Changes one part of the instruction (like an opcode or value).

# MICRO_MUT: Adjusts a memory offset by exactly 1.

# LIBRARY: Pulls an instruction from a library file (see LIBRARY_PATH).

# Breeding & Reproduction:
# CROSSOVERRATE: 1 in this chance of switching between parents when creating offspring.
# TRANSPOSITIONRATE: 1 in this chance of swapping the order of multiple instructions.
# BATTLEROUNDS: How many rounds each match lasts.
