# Python Core War Evolver - Configuration
# =============================================================================
# This file controls how the evolution process works. You can change these
# settings to experiment with different evolution strategies.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 1. Basic Setup
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# How many hours you want the evolution to run.
# You can stop it early at any time by pressing Ctrl+C.
CLOCK_TIME = 24.0

# How many warriors to keep in each arena's population.
# Higher numbers provide more variety but take longer to evolve.
NUMWARRIORS = 500

# Set this to False to start a new evolution from scratch.
# When True, the program will try to resume from existing files.
# Tip: You can also use the --restart flag on the command line to start over.
ALREADYSEEDED = True

# The name of the file where battle results are saved.
# Leave this blank if you do not want to keep a log.
BATTLE_LOG_FILE = battle_log.csv

# If True, the evolution starts immediately in the final Optimization phase.
# Useful if you want to fine-tune your best warriors without starting over.
FINAL_ERA_ONLY = False

# Set to True to see detailed information about every mutation and battle.
VERBOSE = False

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 2. Arena Configuration
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# You can run multiple evolution environments (Arenas) at the same time.
# Each arena can have its own rules, like memory size or battle length.

# The highest numbered arena you want to run.
# For example, if you want 8 arenas (0 through 7), set this to 7.
LAST_ARENA = 7

# The settings below MUST have one value for each arena, separated by commas.
# If LAST_ARENA is 7, each list below must have 8 values.

# Memory size of the virtual computer.
CORESIZE_LIST = 80, 800, 800, 8000, 8000, 8000, 8192, 55440

# Used to clean up memory offsets. Usually the same as CORESIZE.
SANITIZE_LIST = 80, 800, 800, 8000, 8000, 8000, 8192, 55440

# Maximum number of instructions a program can execute before a draw is called.
CYCLES_LIST = 800, 8000, 8000, 80000, 80000, 80000, 100000, 500000

# Maximum number of simultaneous processes a warrior can have.
PROCESSES_LIST = 80, 800, 8, 64, 8000, 8, 8000, 10000

# Maximum allowed length of a warrior (in instructions).
WARLEN_LIST = 5, 20, 50, 100, 100, 100, 300, 200

# Minimum distance between warriors when the battle starts.
WARDISTANCE_LIST = 5, 20, 50, 100, 100, 100, 300, 200

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 3. Evolution Phases (Eras)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The evolution moves through three phases: 1. Exploration, 2. Breeding, 3. Optimization.
# Settings ending in _LIST below must have exactly 3 values.

# The "Marble Bag" Strategy:
# When creating a new warrior, the tool picks a mutation type from a "bag".
# The numbers below determine how many of each "marble" (mutation type) are in the bag.
# Higher numbers make that mutation more likely to happen.

# Do nothing (keeps the parent's instruction exactly as it is).
NOTHING_LIST = 10, 18, 27

# Create a completely random instruction.
RANDOM_LIST = 2, 1, 1

# Borrow an instruction from a warrior in a different arena.
NAB_LIST = 4, 4, 2

# Change one part of an instruction (like an opcode or value).
MINI_MUT_LIST = 3, 4, 2

# Adjust a memory offset by exactly 1.
MICRO_MUT_LIST = 3, 4, 3

# Pull an instruction from the library file (defined in LIBRARY_PATH).
LIBRARY_LIST = 6, 2, 1

# Apply a consistent "magic number" to memory offsets.
MAGIC_NUMBER_LIST = 3, 3, 2

# Saving and loading from the archive:
# These control how often warriors are moved to or from the long-term archive.
ARCHIVE_LIST = 2000, 3000, 3000
UNARCHIVE_LIST = 4000, 2000, 1000

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 4. Genetic & Battle Settings
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The probability of switching parents during breeding (1 in N chance per instruction).
CROSSOVERRATE_LIST = 10, 2, 5

# The probability of swapping the location of instructions (1 in N chance per warrior).
TRANSPOSITIONRATE_LIST = 10, 12, 20

# Number of rounds to fight in each battle.
# High numbers are more accurate but take much longer.
BATTLEROUNDS_LIST = 1, 20, 100

# If True, the winners of battles are given priority for breeding.
PREFER_WINNER_LIST = True, False, False

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 5. Redcode Language Settings
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The path to a file containing a list of successful instructions.
# This is optional. If you don't have one, set LIBRARY_LIST to 0,0,0.
LIBRARY_PATH = instructions.txt

# The set of instructions used when creating random code.
# Repeating an instruction (like MOV) makes it more likely to be chosen.
INSTR_SET = MOV,MOV,MOV,MOV,MOV,MOV,MOV,MOV,MOV,MOV,SPL,SPL,SPL,SPL,SPL,DJN,DJN,DJN,DJN,ADD,SUB,MUL,DIV,MOD,JMP,JMZ,CMP

# The addressing modes available to the warriors.
INSTR_MODES = #,$,*,@,{,<,},>

# The instruction modifiers available to the warriors.
