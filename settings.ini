### Step 1: How should arenas be set up?

#common arenas
#size, cycles, processes, length, distance

##archived 0-3 Global Masters
## 0 GM 1           8000,  80000,    64, 100, 100
## 1 GM 2            160,   1600,   160,   6,   6
## 2 GM 3           8000,  80000,  8000,  80,  80 #and use SANITIZE 9
## 3 GM 4            800,   8000,     4,  20,  20
##

# 0 Nano            80,    800,    80,   5,   5 
# 1 Tiny           800,   8000,   800,  20,  20
# 2 Tiny LP        800,   8000,     8,  50,  50
# 3 94 Medium P   8000,  80000,    64, 100, 100
# 4 94/Std/NOP    8000,  80000,  8000, 100, 100
# 5 94 LP         8000,  80000,     8, 100, 100
# 6 Tourney       8192, 100000,  8000, 300, 300
# 7 Experimental 55440, 500000, 10000, 200, 200

LAST_ARENA=7
#A LAST_ARENA of 7 means you are running 8 arenas
CORESIZE_LIST=80,800,800,8000,8000,8000,8192,55440
SANITIZE_LIST=80,800,800,8000,8000,8000,8192,55440
#Read and write limits currently mirror the core sizes for each arena.
READLIMIT_LIST=80,800,800,8000,8000,8000,8192,55440
WRITELIMIT_LIST=80,800,800,8000,8000,8000,8192,55440
#usually the same as above but may be needed for arenas like Global Masters Round 3.
CYCLES_LIST=800,8000,8000,80000,80000,80000,100000,500000
PROCESSES_LIST=80,800,8,64,8000,8,8000,10000
WARLEN_LIST=5,20,50,100,100,100,300,200
WARDISTANCE_LIST=5,20,50,100,100,100,300,200
SPEC_LIST=1994,1994,1994,1994,1994,1994,1994,1994
#Weights applied when randomly choosing the next arena. Higher values increase the likelihood of selection.
ARENA_WEIGHT_LIST=1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

#ALREDYSEEDED is deprecated. Arenas are automatically seeded when warrior files are missing.

# Number of warriors per arena
NUMWARRIORS=500

#When True, arenas are cached in memory and only written to disk at checkpoints.
IN_MEMORY_ARENAS=True

#Number of battles between automatic disk checkpoints when using in-memory arenas.
ARENA_CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL=10000

#if True, skip the first two eras and go straight to the last one(i.e. if you want to continue fine-tuning where you left off)
#Or you're doing other research into the parameters and don't want them changing.
FINAL_ERA_ONLY=False

### Step 2: What determines survival

# 'nmars' to use the nMars external engine, 'internal' to use the C++ worker, or 'pmars' to use the pMars external engine.
BATTLE_ENGINE=internal

#log file to study progress. Comment out or leave blank to disable logging entirely.
#BATTLE_LOG_FILE=battle_log.csv

# Number of rounds of battle, per era
BATTLEROUNDS_LIST=1,20,100

# These are "bag of marbles" lists of per-era weights:

# Two warriors battle against the benchmark (set to non-zero values once benchmarks are configured)
BENCHMARK_BATTLE_FREQUENCY_LIST=0,0,0
# Random warrior battles the champion
CHAMPION_BATTLE_FREQUENCY_LIST=20,10,5
# Random pair battles
RANDOM_PAIR_BATTLE_FREQUENCY_LIST=100,30,1

### Step 3: How to make offspring

## Step 3a: First, should the winner be archived, or the loser replaced with an unarchived warrior

#my intuition is that at first, unarchiving should be rare:
#-if sharing archive with other runs, will allow unique adaptations to optimize before turning optimized warriors loose
#later on, unarchiving should be more common:
#-plenty of archived warriors to cycle through
ARCHIVE_LIST=2000,3000,3000
UNARCHIVE_LIST=4000,2000,1000
#ARCHIVE_PATH=../shared-archive
#Absolute or relative path to a shared archive directory for multi-instance runs.

## Step 3b: High-level modifications to warrior

# 1 in this chance of switching to picking lines from other warrior, per instruction
CROSSOVERRATE_LIST=10,2,5

# Start with the winner when picking lines (otherwise random)
PREFER_WINNER_LIST=True, False, False

# 1 in this chance of swapping location of multiple instructions, per warrior
TRANSPOSITIONRATE_LIST=10,12,20

## Step 3c: Single-instruction modifications

#Five strategies for mutating a single instruction. Think of it like a bag of marbles of seven different colours, and a different number of each colour.

NOTHING_LIST=10,18,27
#one of the colours of marbles will do nothing to the instruction
RANDOM_LIST=2,1,1
#This colour of marbles will create a completely random instruction.
NAB_LIST=4,4,2
#This will nab an instruction from a different arena. (Set to 0 if you are only running one arena.)
MINI_MUT_LIST=3,4,2
#This will do a mini mutation. (One part of the instruction replaced with something random.)
MICRO_MUT_LIST=3,4,3
#This will do a micro mutation. (One of the numbers in the instruction increased or decreased by 1.)
LIBRARY_LIST=6,2,1
#LIBRARY_LIST=0,0,0
#This will grab an instruction from the instruction library (not included). (Set to 0 if you haven't made a library.)
MAGIC_NUMBER_LIST=3,3,2
#This will replace a constant with the magic number (chosen at beginning of warrior)

#******* Not included with distribution. You do not need to use this. ***********
#instructions to pull from. Maybe a previous evolution run, maybe one or more hand-written warriors.
#one instruction per line. Just assembled instructions, nothing else. If multiple warriors, just concatenated with no breaks.
LIBRARY_PATH=instructions.txt

#Biasing toward more viable warriors. Most popular instructions more likely.
# A weighted list of opcodes for instruction generation. 'MOV' appears 10 times, 'SPL' 5 times, etc., to bias evolution.
INSTR_SET=MOV,MOV,MOV,MOV,MOV,MOV,MOV,MOV,MOV,MOV,SPL,SPL,SPL,SPL,SPL,DJN,DJN,DJN,DJN,ADD,SUB,MUL,DIV,MOD,JMP,JMZ,CMP

# Weighted addressing modes paired with INSTR_SET so the generator favours immediate (`#`), direct (`$`), and related modes as described in the README's biasing section.
INSTR_MODES=#,$,*,@,{,<,},>

# Weighted instruction modifiers. Repeating `A`, `B`, and `AB` increases their odds to match the preferred field combinations during biased instruction generation.
INSTR_MODIF=A,B,AB,BA,F,X,I

### Step 4: End of process

#actual wall clock time in hours you want to take
CLOCK_TIME=24.0

#When True, run a round-robin tournament in each arena after evolution completes.
RUN_FINAL_TOURNAMENT=True

#Directory containing subfolders named `arena0`, `arena1`, etc., each filled with assembled `.red` warriors to use as benchmarks.
BENCHMARK_ROOT=benchmarks

#When True, each arena's evolved warriors are scored against the benchmarks in `BENCHMARK_ROOT` instead of only fighting one another.
BENCHMARK_FINAL_TOURNAMENT=False
